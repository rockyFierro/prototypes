  EXAMPLE TASK:
    - Write an Airplane constructor that initializes `name` from an argument.
    - All airplanes built with Airplane should initialize with an `isFlying` of false.
    - Give airplanes the ability to `.takeOff()` and `.land()`:
        + If a plane takes off, its `isFlying` property is set to true.
        + If a plane lands, its `isFlying` property is set to false.

TASK 1
  - Write a Person Constructor that initializes `name` and `age` from arguments.
  - All instances of Person should initialize with an empty `stomach` array.
  - Give instances of Person the ability to `.eat("someFood")`:
      + When eating an edible, it should be pushed into the `stomach`.
      + The `eat` method should have no effect if there are 10 items in the `stomach`.
  - Give instances of Person the ability to `.poop()`:
      + When an instance poops, its `stomach` should empty.
  - Give instances of Person a method `.toString()`:
      + It should return a string with `name` and `age`. Example: "Mary, 50"

TASK 2
  - Write a Car constructor that initializes `model` and `milesPerGallon` from arguments.
  - All instances built with Car:
      + should initialize with an `tank` at 0
      + should initialize with an `odometer` at 0
  - Give cars the ability to get fueled with a `.fill(gallons)` method. Add the gallons to `tank`.
  - STRETCH: Give cars ability to `.drive(distance)`. The distance driven:
      + Should cause the `odometer` to go up.
      + Should cause the the `tank` to go down taking `milesPerGallon` into account.
  - STRETCH: A car which runs out of `fuel` while driving can't drive any more distance:
      + The `drive` method should return a string "I ran out of fuel at x miles!" x being `odometer`.

// TASK 3
//     -
//     Write a Baby constructor subclassing Person. -
//     Besides `name`
// and `age`, Baby takes a third argument to initialize `favoriteToy`. -
//     Besides the methods on Person.prototype, babies have the ability to `.play()`:

TASK 4

In your own words explain the four principles for the "this" keyword below:
  where does THIS live? and who is talking to THIS?
1. is This global? oh boy, did you just call all of node?
2. is This inside a method? look to its parent object
3. is This inside a New? look at what is being created
4. is This being bound? look to the binding (whats inside its paranthesis)
